Generate "Plant" tokens in the early game, then attack 4 times using the skills of "Dragritter Girl of Flame Blossoms, Radylina", and your "Momokke" token. Once your vanguard is grade 3 or greater, use "Crossing Interdimensional Thoughts, Rorowa"'s ability to create "Plant" tokens, search for units from your deck or send your opponent's rear-guards to the bottom of the deck, while playing "Resolute Pair of Eyes" to power up your token units. You can also evolve your "Momokke" token into "Shell-breaking Wings, Momokke" to retire your opponent's rear-guards, and attack 5 times with the ability of "Undoubting Flame Sword, Radylina"!
