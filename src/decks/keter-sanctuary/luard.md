Use "Dragheart, Luard"'s Generation Break to return key cards like "Dragsaver, Esras" to your deck, and his Stride Bonus to call grade 1 rear-guards like "Preservation Angel", "Dragwizard, Semias", "Dissection Angel", or "Magic of Cycling Wind, Parryris" to adapt to the current situation! Use "Dragstrider, Luard" on your second stride and onwards to unleash a devastating vanguard attack that has 2 critical, 4 drive checks, and stops your opponent from guarding with grade 1 or greater units! Use "Dragwizard, Morfessa" to get additional attacks from your second stride and onwards! Use cards like "Knight of Abruptness Undercover, Deira" and "Knight of Excision, Diorruing" to add key Shadow Paladin cards to your hand!
