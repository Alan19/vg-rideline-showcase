Use your rideline and cards like "Steam Raider Zamuug" or "Veidrock Dragon" to put cards in soul, and bind them face down with Blangdmire, "Elaborate Wizard", or "Single Strike Shatter Colossus" so Blangdmire can give himself more power by binding cards from your soul face-down while binding your opponent's rear-guards! "Elaborate Wizard" and "One Who Walks From Zero, Blangdmire Nexus" can use your bind zone as a toolbox to strengthen your board and hand. Choose the right time to unleash your Divine Skill to finish off your opponent by disabling your opponent's skills and Sentinels when Blangdmire attacks for the rest of the turn!
