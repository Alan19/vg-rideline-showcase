Accumulate World cards in your order zone while riding up as well as through your units' abilities, then send them to drop to call "Shadow Army" tokens with high power through the ability of "Cardinal Mors, Orfist Masques", while performing 3 drive checks! Send World orders from your drop so that you remove non-trigger cards from your deck! Your units have the ability to return World cards from the drop to your order zone after they've been sent to the drop, so carefully manage the number of World cards in your order zone with the amount that you retire to ensure that you have enough for the next turn.
